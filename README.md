## Member Onboarding

Want to join the Pledge and contribute to a healthy Open Source ecosystem? We'd
love to have you! :balloon:

Here's how to join:

1. **Donate $2,000 per full-time developer on staff** to Open Source projects of
   your choice, and commit to doing so in future years. The projects you're
   donating to should meet the [Open Source Definition][osd]. Of course, this
   includes any existing donations you've made this fiscal year. You can donate
   to any projects you like, but if you need help figuring out which projects
   you depend on, you can use a tool like [Thanks.dev](https://thanks.dev/).
2. **Create a short JSON file with your company and donation info**, and host it
   at any URL you wish. You can check out an [example JSON
   report][example-report] or the [full schema][schema].
   * You should update this JSON file at least yearly â€” we'll fetch it
     regularly.
   * All amounts are in USD so that different reports can be compared to each
     other. If you're using a different currency, you should convert all amounts
     to the USD equivalents, using the most appropriate exchange rate.
   * We understand your fiscal year might end on various dates â€” you can record
     the end date of your fiscal year in the `dateYearEnding` field.
   * The logo image in `urlSquareLogoWithBackground` should be square and have a
     non-transparent background. This image should be between 400x400px and
     800x800px, and should be appropriately compressed.
   * The `description` will be shown on your member page and ideally includes a
     general description of your company and some notes on your company's
     relationship with Open Source software.
   * Time and material contributions are optional and do not count towards the
     cash pledge. `monetaryValueOfTime` and `monetaryValueOfMaterials` will show
     up on your member page, because we acknowledge that these kinds of
     contributions are also important.
3. **Create a pull request to add yourself to the member list** by changing
   [members.csv][members-csv].
4. **Include links to your branding materials** in the pull request so that we
   can promote you! For those pledging before September 15, this means you'll be
   included in our major outdoor advertising campaign.

Once that's all done, you'll officially be a member. This means that your
company and reports will show up on [our website][osp], and you'll be entitled
to use the [Open Source Pledge Member logo][member-logo] on your website and
marketing materials if you wish. Thank you so much for joining us in
contributing to a healthy Open Source ecosystem that supports maintainers.

If you have any questions, feel free to [open an issue][new-issue], and the
relevant member of our team will get back to you.
